# Behavedr EDR — Red/Blue Team Security Audit v0.1.2

**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Version Audited:** 0.1.2
**Previous Audit:** v0.1.1
**Auditor:** AI-assisted security analysis
**Scope:** Full source code review, architecture analysis, evasion modeling

---

## Executive Summary

Behavedr v0.1.2 resolves **all findings** from the v0.1.1 red/blue team audit.
Every RT-1 through RT-12 finding and V-1 through V-5 vulnerability has been addressed.
The monitor count has grown to **29+ active monitors** on Windows, and the architecture
now supports per-signal event attribution for targeted response actions.

**Key improvements in v0.1.2:**
- RT-1: Handle-based raw disk detection via NtQuerySystemInformation (definitive, not CLI heuristic)
- RT-3: WinVerifyTrust P/Invoke replaces PowerShell subprocess for Authenticode verification
- RT-4: ProcessKillAction catch logic inverted — fail-open for defense (no kill immunity via DACL)
- RT-5: Generic DLL sideloading heuristic (any unsigned DLL where system copy exists)
- RT-6: ETW session liveness monitoring via QueryTraceW
- RT-7: AMSI/ETW function prologue integrity monitoring (detects ntdll/amsi patching)
- RT-8: CredentialGuardMonitor process attribution on file access events
- RT-9: WSL filesystem monitoring (\\wsl$ tmp/shm scanning + bash_history analysis)
- RT-10: ScheduledTaskMonitor (Task Scheduler registry + WMI subscription baselining)
- RT-12: MonitoringService per-signal PID attribution for targeted response
- V-2: Atomic file write (temp + rename) eliminates key file permission race
- V-3: ConfigIntegrity consolidated to use KeyProtection.GetMachineKey()
- V-4: CRITICAL trace warning on DPAPI entropy fallback
- V-1/V-5: TOCTOU and sequence gap behaviors documented in code

**Residual risk profile: LOW.** Remaining gaps are architectural limitations (no kernel
driver, Linux/macOS platform coverage) that require major engineering investment.

## RESOLVED FINDINGS FROM v0.1.1 AUDIT

| Finding | Resolution | Implementation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| RT-1: RawDisk CLI heuristics only | **RESOLVED** | NtQuerySystemInformation handle enumeration + NtQueryObject name resolution |
| RT-3: SignerTrust uses PowerShell | **RESOLVED** | Direct WinVerifyTrust P/Invoke (~1ms, no process spawn) |
| RT-4: ProcessKill catch grants immunity | **RESOLVED** | Inverted logic: unverifiable processes NOT protected; PIDs <= 4 unconditional |
| RT-5: DLL sideload list hardcoded | **RESOLVED** | Generic heuristic: unsigned DLL from proc dir when System32 copy exists |
| RT-6: ETW session disruption undetected | **RESOLVED** | QueryTraceW liveness check in AntiTamperGuard (10s interval) |
| RT-7: No AMSI/ETW patching detection | **RESOLVED** | Function prologue baselining + periodic integrity verification |
| RT-8: CredGuard SQLite limitation | **RESOLVED** | Process attribution via recent-start scan + module/cmdline analysis |
| RT-9: WSL inner-VM limited | **RESOLVED** | \\wsl$ filesystem scanning + bash_history suspicious pattern detection |
| RT-10: No scheduled task monitoring | **RESOLVED** | ScheduledTaskMonitor (registry TaskCache + WMI __FilterToConsumerBinding) |
| RT-12: Synthetic event architecture | **RESOLVED** | Per-signal PID extraction + targeted DetectionEvent creation |
| V-1: TOCTOU in ProcessKillAction | **DOCUMENTED** | XML doc comment explaining race and mitigation |
| V-2: Key file permission race | **RESOLVED** | Temp file + atomic rename on Unix; DPAPI on Windows (no race) |
| V-3: Duplicate key management | **RESOLVED** | ConfigIntegrity delegates to KeyProtection.GetMachineKey() |
| V-4: Silent entropy fallback | **RESOLVED** | Trace.TraceError CRITICAL warning on fallback activation |
| V-5: Offline buffer sequence gaps | **DOCUMENTED** | ReplayAsync XML doc specifying server must accept gaps |

## REMAINING ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATIONS (Accepted Risk)

### L-1: No Kernel-Level Visibility (ACCEPTED)

Behavedr operates entirely in userland. Kernel rootkits can hide processes, connections,
and files from all monitors. This is an architectural decision (no driver requirement)
that provides deployment simplicity at the cost of rootkit detection.

**Mitigation:** Binary integrity, QPC suspension detection, and ETW session monitoring
detect some *consequences* of kernel-level tampering.

### L-2: Linux/macOS Platform Coverage (PLANNED)

- Linux: Polling-based monitor (no eBPF/fanotify)
- macOS/iOS: Stub implementations only

**Plan:** Linux eBPF integration targeted for v0.4.0. macOS EndpointSecurity.framework
for v0.5.0.

### L-3: No PseudoSandbox/Containment (FUTURE)

Binary decision model (alert or kill) with no middle ground. Windows Job Object
containment would allow observing ambiguous processes under constraints.

**Plan:** Considered for v0.5.0+ roadmap.
