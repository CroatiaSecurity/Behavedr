## Security Architecture

### Design Principles

- **Userland operation.** No kernel driver requirement. Reduces attack surface and deployment complexity at the cost of kernel rootkit visibility. Full behavioral detection on Windows (ETW + P/Invoke), Linux (cn_proc, fanotify, /proc, auth logs, kernel modules), and macOS (kqueue process + VNODE file watches, codesign checks).
- **Least privilege where possible.** SYSTEM context is required for ETW, process inspection, and response actions. File permissions are restricted to SYSTEM and Administrators on Windows; systemd hardening applies on Linux.
- **Defense in depth.** Multiple independent self-protection mechanisms. No single bypass disables all detection.
- **Fail-closed communication.** TLS connections are rejected without a valid pinned CA certificate. No fallback to insecure transport.
- **Cryptographic integrity.** All local storage uses authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM). Configuration files are HMAC-sealed. Updates require RSA-4096 PSS signatures. Policy verification uses a dedicated verifier path (key may still be dual-use until rotated — see [docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md](docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md)).
- **Minimal attack surface.** Single-file deployment. No temp extraction for the running agent image. Deterministic builds. Pinned dependencies with lock files on desktop projects.

### Cryptographic Inventory

| Operation | Algorithm | Key Size | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Machine key protection | DPAPI (LocalMachine) + entropy | 256-bit | Per-install random entropy prevents cross-machine unwrap |
| Local encryption | AES-256-GCM | 256-bit | Purpose-specific keys derived via HKDF-SHA256 |
| Config integrity | HMAC-SHA256 | 256-bit | Key derived from machine key via HKDF |
| Update signing | RSA-PSS SHA-256 | 4096-bit | Private key offline; public key baked into binary |
| Policy signing | RSA-PSS SHA-256 | 4096-bit | Separate `PolicySignatureVerifier` path; may share material until rotation |
| Transport | TLS 1.3 (mTLS) | 2048-bit client cert | CA-pinned; fail-closed |
| Config value encryption | AES-256-GCM (cross-platform) / DPAPI (Windows) | 256-bit | DPAPI uses LocalMachine scope |
| macOS key storage | Keychain Services (System Keychain) | 256-bit | Via `security` CLI; Secure Enclave-backed on Apple Silicon when available |
| Android key storage | Android Keystore (TEE/StrongBox preferred) | 256-bit | Hardware-backed when device supports it |

### Supply Chain Controls

Documented in full in [docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md](docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md). Summary:

- Deterministic builds (`Directory.Build.props`)
- Package lock files for Agent, Core, Tests; CI `--locked-mode`
- Pinned CI action SHAs (no floating tags)
- SBOM generation on Linux release builds (best-effort tool install)
- Signed auto-updates with RSA-4096 PSS verification
- Release `SHA256SUMS` (+ `.sig` when `UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY` is configured)
- Android APK hard-required for release workflow
- Vulnerability audit in CI (`dotnet list package --vulnerable`)
- Dependabot for NuGet and GitHub Actions
- Optional Authenticode / codesign / Android keystore when secrets are present
- Local build capability via `installer/build.ps1` (no CI dependency for Windows portable/installer builds)

## Known Limitations

These are current, intentional, or residual limits — not a backlog disguised as features.

- **No kernel-level visibility.** Kernel rootkits can hide from userland monitors. Operational “10/10” is defined as best-in-class userland + supply chain, not omnipotence against ring-0 adversaries.
- **Native ETW requires elevation** (SYSTEM/admin). Falls back to WMI polling without it.
- **macOS real-time:** EndpointSecurity client is implemented (`MacOSEndpointSecurityMonitor` + `libbehavedr_es.dylib`). Without Apple ES entitlement the client fails soft and **kqueue** remains active. Optional AUTH denylist via `BEHAVEDR_ES_AUTH=1`.
- **Linux real-time:** eBPF exec path is implemented (`LinuxEbpfExecMonitor` + `native/linux/ebpf`). Without CAP_BPF / object file, **cn_proc** remains primary.
- **Single-process agent architecture.** A successful privileged kill terminates protection until SCM/systemd/watchdog restart (seconds, not continuous multiproc resilience).
- **Health-check auto-rollback** restores from `.previous` when post-update crypto health fails. It does **not** cover every possible failure mode (e.g. partial file locks on Windows may require manual recovery or reinstall).
- **DPAPI entropy fallback** to a fixed value when the filesystem is unwritable (containers). Logged as CRITICAL.
- **WFP user-mode filters** via `WindowsWfpEngine` (fwpuclnt); advfirewall fallback. **No callout driver** / deep packet inspection.
- **OS code-signing is optional** and depends on repository secrets. Releases without Authenticode/codesign/keystore must not be described as OS-trusted. Agent-enforced RSA-PSS is independent of OS trust.
- **Policy and update keys are distinct as of 0.3.0** (separate RSA-4096 pairs). Server must sign policies with `policy-signing-key.pem`.
- **Play Integrity** may degrade if the official dependency / cloud project number is not fully wired for a given build; treat attestation quality as deployment-specific.
- **iOS is an MDM companion SKU**, not full-device EDR (sandbox quarantine, App Attest hooks; NE/MDM for real network control).
- **Default response mode is AlertOnly.** Active kill/isolate is an operator decision with legal and operational consequences.
